**Please note:** For the new InvoiceXpress API 2.0, there is a new client available at [digfish/ivx-api2-php](https://github.com/digfish/ivx-api2-php) .

## InvoiceXpressRequest-PHP-API

A simple PHP wrapper for making requests with the InvoiceXpress API

Slightly modified, cleaned some redundant code for use with ivxapi
Made 'compose'-able with the addition of composer.json

Made slightly corrections since the methods that made use of the HTTP GET command
are not using XML anymore.
